### benchmarking and comparison
Benchmark comparison between the following sorting algorithms:
* selection_sort
* insertion_sort
* heap_sort
* merge_sort
* quick_sort
* radix_sort
- crystal_sort
- push_sort

The code for the standard (well known) algorithms are taken from:
https://stackabuse.com/sorting-algorithms-in-python
https://www.programiz.com/dsa/radix-sort

The last algorithms (crystal_sort, push_sort) are coded by me and are the ones that are actually being tested and compared to the others
